# Movie-Application

Extensive metadata for movies can help fans around the globe explore the world of movies and entertainment. Users can read reviews, decide on what movies to watch based on user ratings and reviews. To expose the users to data, APIs are created. These APIs are the building blocks of modern applications, that allow applications to communicate with each other. APIs can be created using a framework or pure JavaScript called as VanillaJS. 

This project includes REST API using vanilla JS to manage the movie details. The Node application reads the data from a .json file as a REST resource and able to add a new movie, fetch all the movies, fetch a specific movie by id, delete a movie and update the details of a specific movie.
